/**
 * Allows to run a layout in a distinct thread.
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A layout runner will run in its own thread and periodically activate a layout
 * algorithm on a graph event stream (you do not need a graph). This
 * implementation is mainly used by the graph viewer but could be used by any
 * program that needs a layout algorithm that run continuously on a dynamic
 * graph (adapting the layout as the graph changes).
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The layout algorithms in GraphStream are iterative versions that can be
 * called repeatedly to take graph dynamics into account and may produce a
 * result only after several invocations. This is why the layout runner invokes
 * the layout on a regular basis. The runner is temporized, it will not run in a
 * loop as fast as possible, instead it will wait a little between each layout
 * invocation. When the last layout invocation indicated the layout was good, it
 * will wait longer that when the last invocation indicated the layout was not
 * good (stabilized). These two times can be configured using
 * {@link #setNaps(long, long)}.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Once you finished using the runner, you must call {@link #release()} to break
 * the link with the event source and stop the thread. The runner cannot be used
 * after.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
