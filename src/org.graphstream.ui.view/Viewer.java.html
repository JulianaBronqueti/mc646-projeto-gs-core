/**
 * Set of views on a graphic graph.
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The viewer class is in charge of maintaining :
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;A &quot;graphic graph&quot; (a special graph that internally stores the graph under
 * the form of style sets of &quot;graphic&quot; elements, suitable to draw the graph, but
 * not to adapted to used it as a general graph),&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The eventual proxy pipe from which the events come from (but graph events
 * can come from any kind of source),&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;A default view, and eventually more views on the graphic graph.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;A flag that allows to repaint the view only if the graphic graph changed.
 * &lt;li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The graphic graph can be created by the viewer or given at construction (to
 * share it with another viewer).
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;u&gt;Once created, the viewer runs in a loop inside the UI thread. You cannot
 * call methods on it directly if you are not in this thread&lt;/u&gt;. The only
 * operation that you can use in other threads is the constructor, the
 * {@link #addView(View)}, {@link #removeView(String)} and the {@link #close()}
 * methods. Other methods are not protected from concurrent accesses.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Some constructors allow a {@link ProxyPipe} as argument. If given, the
 * graphic graph is made listener of this pipe and the pipe is &quot;pumped&quot; during
 * the view loop. This allows to run algorithms on a graph in the main thread
 * (or any other thread) while letting the viewer run in the ui thread.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Be very careful: due to the nature of graph events in GraphStream, the viewer
 * is not aware of events that occured on the graph &lt;u&gt;before&lt;/u&gt; its creation.
 * There is a special mechanism that replay the graph if you use a proxy pipe or
 * if you pass the graph directly. However, when you create the viewer by
 * yourself and only pass a {@link Source}, the viewer &lt;u&gt;will not&lt;/u&gt; display
 * the events that occured on the source before it is connected to it.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
